                         Automation for the rest of us

                      Installation and Quick Start Guide

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Quick Install
    -------------

Un-tar the expect-lite tar ball, and run the included install.sh Test by 
typing at the prompt:

expect-lite

If you see the help, then it is ready to go, installation is complete!


    Quick Start
    -----------

Expect-lite has many features which make it useful, and the documenation
<http://expect-lite.sourceforge.net/> highlights those. But to start
using expect-lite quickly, you require two items:

   1. a script
   2. a host 

Here is a quick script which you can paste into a file to test
expect-lite, call it test.elt :

; ==== Ping localhost and report result ====
@5
>ping -c 2 localhost
+$packet_rx=([0-9]+) received
>
>echo "Packets received are:$packet_rx"

The second item you require is a host to run your script against.
Expect-lite is designed to log into a remote host and run your script,
as if a person was typing the commands. However that may require setting
up ssh keys and so forth, and this is the Quick Start section. Type the
following to run the above script on your localhost:

expect-lite r=none c=test.elt

There should be output that looks similar to the following:

cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ 
cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ ping -c 2 localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.053 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.056 ms

--- localhost ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.053/0.054/0.056/0.007 ms
cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ 
Assigned Var:packet_rx=2


cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ echo "Packets received:2"
Packets received:2

##Overall Result: PASS 

Congratulations you have just run your first expect-lite script! 


    Quick Doc
    ---------

To learn more about expect-lite please look at the documentation. expect-lite
interprets the script based on the first  character of the line. Here's a
short list of what is available to get you started:
     > send to remote host, implies "wait for prompt"
     < _MUST_ be received, or script will report failure
     # are comment lines, and have no effect
     ; are printable (in stdout) comments, and have no other effect
     @ change the expect timeout value
     ? If statement, use format ?cond?action::else_action

There are many more commands supported in expect-lite, it really is worth
reading the documentation.
