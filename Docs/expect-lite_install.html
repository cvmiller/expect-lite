<h2>Download<br></h2>expect-lite can be downloaded from&nbsp;the expect-lite Project Page: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expect-lite">http://sourceforge.net/projects/expect-lite</a><br>The tar.gz package includes the latest expect-lite, as well as over 25 examples.<br>
      <br>
Or, if you are running a modern version of Ubuntu: apt-get install expect-lite<br><br>
Or, if you are running a modern version of gentoo: emerge -u expect-lite<br>
<br><h2>Quick Install</h2>Untar the expect-lite package, and copy the expect-lite file in your path (typically ~/bin/). <br><pre>cp expect-lite ~/bin/</pre>Test by typing at the prompt:<br>
<pre>expect-lite</pre>
If you see the help, then it is ready to go, installation is complete!<br>
<br>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
Expect-lite has many features which make it useful, and the <a href="http://expect-lite.sourceforge.net/">documenation</a>
highlights
those. But to start using expect-lite quickly, you require two items:<br>
<ol>
<li>a script</li>
<li>a host&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
Here is a quick script which you can paste into a file to test
expect-lite,&nbsp;call it test.elt :<br>
<pre>; ==== Ping localhost and report result ====<br>@5<br>&gt;ping -c 2 localhost<br>+$packet_rx=([0-9]+) received<br>&gt;<br>&gt;echo "Packets received are:$packet_rx"<br></pre>
The second item you require is a host to run your script against.
Expect-lite is designed to log into a remote host and run your script,
as if a person was typing the commands. However that may require
setting up ssh keys and so forth, and this is the Quick Start section.
Type the following to run the above script on your localhost:<br>
<pre>expect-lite -c test.elt -r none</pre>
There should be output that looks similar to the following:<br>
<pre>cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ <br>cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ ping -c 2 localhost<br>PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.<br>64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.053 ms<br>64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.056 ms<br><br>--- localhost ping statistics ---<br>2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms<br>rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.053/0.054/0.056/0.007 ms<br>cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ <br>Assigned Var:packet_rx=2<br><br><br>cvmiller@maile:~/Freescale$ echo "Packets received:2"<br>Packets received:2<br><br>##Overall Result: PASS <br></pre>Congratulations
you have just run your first expect-lite script! expect-lite is
designed to run in a multi-user environment, utilizing shell variables
to set one's preferences. <br>
<br>
<h2>Customizing expect-lite<br>
</h2>
<a name="more_details"></a>There are aspects of expect-lite which you
may want to tune to your environment. As of version 4.0.1,
customization is controlled through shell environment variables. It is
recommended that the variables be set in the shell init script, such as
.bashrc file. A sample bashrc file is supplied in the expect-lite
package. The contents of which are as follows:<br>
      <pre># bashrc<br><br># append this sample bashrc to your .bashrc to set customize expect-lite<br><br># remote host to connect, default=none<br># 	expect-lite was designed to automate server farm environments<br>#	However, it can also be run from the local machine or PC by setting<br>#	this value to 'none'. The CLI option -r &lt;rhost&gt; will overide this value<br>#export EL_REMOTE_HOST=localhost<br><br># name of expect-lite script<br>#	Good for testing one script over and over<br>#export EL_CMD_FILE=<br><br># change to this dir upon login<br>#export EL_USER_DIR=<br><br># Login method to remote host<br>#	expect-lite includes a utilty (setup_local_ssh.sh) to automatically setup ssh <br>#	keys for the user to use with the localhost. This is the fastest method <br>#	of script execution, much faster than 'none'.<br>#	Choose one login method: telnet|ssh|ssh_key|none<br>#export EL_CONNECT_METHOD=ssh_key<br>export EL_CONNECT_METHOD=none<br><br># username for telnet|ssh|ssh_key access methods<br># User is also used by ssh_key method as well. If user is blank then the default<br>#	user will be used (the user running the script). However if $user is defined<br>#	then ssh_key will use the following command: ssh $user@$host<br>#export EL_CONNECT_USER=<br><br># password for telnet|ssh access methods<br>#export EL_CONNECT_PASS=<br><br># Delay (in ms) to wait for host in Not Expect, and Dynamic Var Capture<br># 100 ms is a good value for a local LAN, 200 ms if running across high speed internet<br>#export EL_DELAY_WAIT_FOR_HOST=<br><br># User defined constants<br>#EL_*                         <br><br></pre>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="connect_method"></a>EL_CONNECT_METHOD<br>
      </h2>
expect-lite was designed for a server farm environment, and as such can
automatically connect and log into a remote host. expect-lite supports
three methods to connect to
remote hosts. <br>
      <br>

Expect-lite supports three connection methods:<br>

      <ol>
<li>telnet</li><li>ssh</li><li>ssh_key</li>
      </ol>
The ssh_key method is the most secure, as no passwords
are utilized. However this requires setting up ssh keys prior to using
this method. <br>

      <pre># Login method to remote host<br>#	expect-lite includes a utilty (setup_local_ssh.sh) to automatically setup ssh <br>#	keys for the user to use with the localhost. This is the fastest method <br>#	of script execution, much faster than 'none'.<br>#	Choose one login method: telnet|ssh|ssh_key|none<br>export EL_CONNECT_METHOD=ssh_key<br><br></pre>

There is a forth method, as shown in the Quick Start, where no remote
login is performed. This method was designed primarily for the Quick Start
section, however, it can be used for most scripts (including in the Cygwin environment). To invoke this method the
value of "none" is given for the remote host on the command line.<br>

      <pre>expect-lite -r none -c test.elt<br></pre>
Even when
no remote host is required, it is best to log into the localhost, since
the underlying Expect has problems with synchronization (between send
and expect strings) when a remote host is 'none'. The provided
shell script 'setup_local_ssh.sh' (in the Tools directory) will setup
the localhost with ssh keys. It is only necessary to run it once:<br>
      <pre>./Tools/setup_local_ssh.sh</pre>
<br>
<h2><a name="user_name_password"></a>EL_CONNECT_USER &amp; EL_CONNECT_PASS<br>
</h2>The connection methods telnet &amp; ssh require user name and
password. A different user can be used for the ssh_key method as well,
by setting EL_CONNECT_USER. The ssh_key is most secure since the user
name and passwords are not used. However this may not be practical for
your environment.<br>
<pre># username for telnet|ssh|ssh_key access methods<br># User is also used by ssh_key method as well. If user is blank then the default<br>#	user will be used (the user running the script). However if $user is defined<br>#	then ssh_key will use the following command: ssh $user@$host<br>#export EL_CONNECT_USER=<br><br># password for telnet|ssh access methods<br>#export EL_CONNECT_PASS=<br><br></pre>
The default username and passwords are blank, and are not used for the 'none' connection method.<br><br>

<h2><a name="delay_wait_for_host"></a>EL_DELAY_WAIT_FOR_HOST</h2>
Because of the nature of accessing a remote host, expect-lite may have
to wait for a response if the access is slow (eg. over a VPN via the
internet).<br>
<pre>## Delay (in ms) to wait for host in Not Expect, and Dynamic Var Capture<br># 100 ms is a good value for a local LAN, 200 ms if running across high speed internet<br>#export EL_DELAY_WAIT_FOR_HOST=<br><br></pre>
The value of 100 ms is a good value for a local LAN, while 200 ms may
be desired if running across high speed internet. As this value is
increased the script will run slower. It is recommended that a minimum
value be used to prevent scripts from taking too long to run.<br>
      <br>
<h2><a name="comment_color"></a>EL_*</h2>The last section of the sample
bashrc file is reserved for the user. expect-lite will read in any
shell environment variable which begins with EL_<br>
      <br>
The shell variables are treated as constants in the expect-lite script, overriding any internal variables.<br><pre># User defined constants<br>#export EL_*                         <br>export EL_root_pass=mysecret<br></pre>
