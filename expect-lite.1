.TH EXPECT-LITE "1" "April 2014" "expect-lite version 4.7.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
expect-lite \- a quick and easy command line automation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B expect-lite 
[\fI\-vv\fR] \fI-c <script>\fR [\fI-r <host>\fR]  [\fICONSTANT=value\fR] [\fI*DIRECTIVE\fR] [-h|--help]
.br
or
.br
.B script.elt 
[\fI\-vv\fR]  [\fIr=<host>\fR] [\fICONSTANT=value\fR] [\fI*DIRECTIVE\fR] [-h|--help]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ds sd \fIexpect-lite\fP
.PP
Written in Expect, it is designed to directly map an interactive terminal session into an
automation script. expect-lite scripts use punctuation character(s) at the beginning of each line
to indicate the action. Basic expect-lite scripts can be created by simply cutting and pasting
text from a terminal window into a script, and adding \fB>\fR \fB<\fR characters. Knowledge of
Expect is not required.

.PP
usage: expect\-lite remote_host=<remote_host_IP> cmd_file=<command_file> [user_dir=<user_dir>] [const1=value1] [*DIRECTIVE]
.PP
or short form: expect\-lite r=<remote_host_IP> c=<command_file> [d=<user_dir>] [const1=value1] [*DIRECTIVE]
.IP
eg. ./expect\-lite r=host\-008  c=pm_alt.elt  d=/local/sw myvar=myvalue *NOCOLOR

COMMAND SYNOPSIS
.PP
This  is  just a brief synopsis of \*(sd commands to serve as a reminder to those who already
know \*(sd;  other  documentation  (such  as  the  html  document)  must  be  consulted  for 
more complete descriptions.
.SS
Special Characters
.TP
>
wait for a prompt, then send string to the remote host
.TP
>>
send string to remote host, without waiting for prompt 

.TP
<
string/regex MUST be received from the remote host in the alloted timeout or the script will FAIL! 
.TP
<< 	
literal string MUST be received (similar to '<' without regex evaluation)
.TP
-<

;
are also used to indicate comment lines, but are printed to stdout (for logging)
.TP
;<colour> comment
add custom colour comment lines, colour may be blue, ltblue, gray, ltgray, cyan, black, pink, purple, red, green, yellow
.TP
;;
similar to above, but no extra newlines are printed (useful for printing script help)
.TP
;;;
marks beginning and ending of a block of help text. Help Text is user defined help for a script and is printed when -h or --help is on the command line
.TP
@num

.TP
-$var

.TP
=$var
math functions, perform bitwise and arithmetic operations:  << >> & | ^ * / % + - (see math functions)
.TP

.TP
?
c-style if/then/else in the format ?cond?action::else_action. code block are also supported in the action and else_action statements. e.g. 
.br
.RS 10

.br
   +$i
.br
]
.RE
.IP
Foreach Loop, using code blocks, each iteration $item is assigned the next item in the list. List \fBmust\fR be space delimited e.g.

.br
    >echo $item
.br
]
.RE
.TP
%
label - used for jumping to labels 
.TP
~\fIfilename\fP [constant=value] [constant=value with spaces] 
includes a expect-lite script file, useful for creation of common variable files, or 'subprograms/subroutines'. Can pass optional parameters which will override (as constants) the variables in the include file. Constant values passed may have spaces, no quotes are required
.PP
.SS
Directives
.TP
*~\fIfilename\fP
Include a fail script, which expect-lite runs only if the main script fails 
.TP
*/prompt/
Set a user defined prompt (defined in regex)
.TP
*TERM or *PASS
Immediately terminates script, but returns 0 (pass) 
.TP
*FAIL
Immediately fails script, and returns 1 (fail) 
.TP
*NOFAIL
Script will run to completion, and returns 1, if failure occured during execution, or 0, if pass (it is a sticky flag, and can not be unset)
.TP
**SHELL=<shell>
Configuration directive which sets the shell imediately after automatic login to remote host (see setting the shell)
.TP
*INTERACT
A breakpoint which places user in interact mode, and pauses the script and turns control of the keyboard over to the user 
.TP
*NOINTERACT
Once set, will ignore all succeding breakpoints (*INTERACT). This permits running a  script or scripts in an unattended regression. This can not be unset (it is a sticky flag)
.TP
*FORK <session>
Multiple session support. Directs expect-lite to open a new session and spawns a newshell 
.TP
*SHOW VARS
Debug information, displays all expect-lite variables. Can be used in interact mode.
.TP
*INFINITE_LOOP N
Infinite loop protection value, sets N as new value
.TP
*EOLS LF|*EOLS CRLF
Controls end of line sequence sent to remote host, either line feed, or carriage return + line feed.
.TP
*NOINCLUDE
Once set, will ignore all succeding include files (lines starting with ~). This was the default behaviour in Library mode (introduced in v4.1). This behavour is no longer default, and this directive provides a method to previous behavior.

.P
.SS
Logging
.PP
Logging encompases two operations: 1) writing script output to a file, 2) controlling additional messages, such as info, exp_info and warnings. All logging commands when used on the CLI will override those inside the script
.TP
*LOG|*NOLOG
Enable/disable logging of standard out and messages to a file. The log file name will be <script_name>.log saved in the script directory.(see Environment Variable EL_LOG_EXT below)
.TP
*LOG <file_name>|*LOGAPPEND <file_name>
Enable logging to a user specified path/file_name. When invoked on the CLI, the specified file_name must end in ".log" (or as defined by EL_LOG_EXT) to avoid ambiguity 
.TP
*INFO|*NOINFO
Enable/disable informational messages
.TP
*EXP_INFO|*NOEXP_INFO
Enable/disable "expected" messages (addtionally use -V flag to enable) 
.TP
*WARN|*NOWARN
Enable/disable warning messages
.TP
*DEBUG|*NODEBUG
Enable/disable debug messages
.TP
*NOCOLOR
Disables color on stdout
.TP
*TIMESTAMP <ISO|YMD|DMY|MDY>
Prints Date and Timestamp for each command sent, ISO is default. Timestamps will be written to log file when *LOG is used.
.TP
*NOTIMESTAMP
Disables timestamp printing


.P

.SS 
Environment Variables 
.PP
It is no longer necessary to hand edit the expect-lite script itself. All parameters such as connect_method, login name and password are controlled via shell environment variables. This permits individual customization in a multi user environment. It is recommended to save these values in \fI.expect-literc\fR and source it from .bashrc or .cshrc. If set, the following environment variables will be used:
.TP
EL_CONNECT_METHOD
The method expect-lite uses to connect to remote host. Valid options are: none|telnet|ssh|ssh_key Default is none
.TP
EL_CONNECT_USER
User name to use for login on remote host (telnet|ssh)
.TP
EL_CONNECT_PASS
Password to use for login on remote host (telnet|ssh)
.TP
EL_INFINITE_LOOP=N
Infinite loop protection value, sets N to user's default value
.TP
EL_DELAY_WAIT_FOR_HOST
Delay (in ms) to wait for host in Not Expect, and Dynamic Var Capture. 100 ms is a good value for a local LAN, 200 ms if running across high speed internet
.TP
EL_REMOTE_HOST
Name or IP of remote host
.TP
EL_CMD_FILE
Name of expect-lite script to run
.TP
EL_USER_DIR
Change to this directory upon login before executing script
.TP
EL_SHELL
Start this shell (default bash) when using EL_CONNECT_METHOD=none
.TP
EL_LOG_EXT
Set the log file name extension string (default=".log") which is appended to the script name when uusing *LOG without file name argument or used to detect a log file name on the command line.
.TP
EL_*
Any other shell environment variables starting with EL_ will become constants
.PP



.SS
Debugger (IDE)
.PP
The debugger performs three primary functions: 1) connecting the user to the remote host or device under test, 2) monitoring special commands prefaced with the escape key for stepping, and other functions, and 3) the debugger will allow expect-lite script lines to be executed by either typing directly or pasting them into the IDE.
.PP
The debugger is invoked at a breakpoint by placing the *INTERACT command in the script, or using by instant-interact at anytime during the script execution by pressing ctrl+backslash ^\\
.TP
<esc>s
Step, execute next step in script
.TP
<esc>k
sKip next step in script
.TP
<esc>c
Continue execution of the script
.TP
<esc>v
show Vars, display expect-lite variables and values
.TP
<esc>0to9
display next N lines of script
.TP
<esc>-1to-9
display last N lines of script
.TP
ctrl+d
Quit & Exit expect-lite
.TP
<esc>h
display Help
.TP
[pasted line(s)]
execute any pasted line(s) from a script into the IDE
.TP
[type any expect-lite line]
execute any typed expect-lite script line
