.SH NAME
expect-lite \- a quick and easy command line automation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B expect-lite 
[\fI\-vv\fR] \fI-c <script>\fR [\fI-r <host>\fR]  [\fICONSTANT=value\fR] [\fI*DIRECTIVE\fR]
.br
or

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ds sd \fIexpect-lite\fP
.PP
Written in Expect, it is designed to directly map an interactive terminal session into an
automation script. expect-lite scripts use punctuation character(s) at the beginning of each line
to indicate the action. Basic expect-lite scripts can be created by simply cutting and pasting
text from a terminal window into a script, and adding '>' '<' characters. Knowledge of
Expect is not required.

.PP
usage: expect\-lite remote_host=<remote_host_IP> cmd_file=<command_file> [user_dir=<user_dir>] [const1=value1] [*DIRECTIVE]
.PP
or short form: expect\-lite r=<remote_host_IP> c=<command_file> [d=<user_dir>] [const1=value1] [*DIRECTIVE]
.IP
eg. ./expect\-lite r=host\-008  c=pm_alt.elt  d=/local/sw myvar=myvalue *NOCOLOR
.TP
additional login options: user_name=<username> user_password=<password>
.IP
eg. ./expect\-lite r=host\-008 c=pm_alt.elt u=superuser p=mysecret
.PP
additional debug options: \fB\-v\fR|\fB\-vv\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
prints warnings, and infos (i.e. conditionals, dynamic var assignments)
.TP
\fB\-vv\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR
prints warnings and debug (i.e. expect match info)
.TP
eg. ./expect\-lite \-v r=host\-008 c=pm_alt.elt

COMMAND SYNOPSIS
.PP
This  is  just a brief synopsis of \*(sd commands to serve as a reminder to those who already
know \*(sd;  other  documentation  (such  as  the  html  document)  must  be  consulted  for 
fuller descriptions.

<< 	
literal string MUST be received (similar to '<' without regex evaluation)
.TP
-<

.TP
#
used to indicate comment lines, and have no effect
.TP
;
are also used to indicate comment lines, but are printed to stdout (for logging)
.TP
;;
similar to above, but no extra newlines are printed (useful for printing script help)
.TP
@num
changes the expect timeout to num of seconds
.TP
$var=
static variable assignment at script invocation 
.TP
+$var=
.RI
dynamic variable assignment  
.TP
+$var
increment value of $var by 1 decimal 
.TP
-$var
decrement value of $var by 1 decimal
.TP
=$var
math functions, perform bitwise and arithmetic operations:  << >> & | ^ * / % + - (see math functions)
.TP
!
indicates an embedded expect line 
.TP

Directives
.TP
*~\fIfilename\fP
Include a fail script, which expect-lite runs only if the main script fails 
.TP

.TP
*TERM
Immediately terminates script, but returns 0 (pass) 
.TP

.TP
**SHELL=<shell>
Configuration directive which sets the shell imediately after automatic login to remote host (see setting the shell)
.TP
*INTERACT
A breakpoint which places user in interact mode, and pauses the script and turns control of the keyboard over to the user 
.TP
*FORK <session>
Multiple session support. Directs expect-lite to open a new session and spawns a newshell 
.TP
*SHOW VARS
Debug information, displays all expect-lite variables. Can be used in interact mode.
.TP

Infinite loop protection value, sets N as new value
.TP
*EOLS LF|*EOLS CRLF

.P
.SS
Logging
.TP
*INFO|*NOINFO

.TP
*DEBUG|*NODEBUG
Enable/disable debug messages
.TP

Environment Variables 
.PP
It is no longer necessary to hand edit the expect-lite script itself. All parameters such as connect_method, login name and password are controlled via shell environment variables. This permits individual customization in a multi user environment. It is recommended to save these values in the .bashrc or .cshrc. If set, the following environment variables will be used:
.TP
EL_connect_method
The method expect-lite uses to connect to remote host. Valid options are: none|telnet|ssh|ssh_key Default is none
.TP
EL_user
User name to use for login on remote host
.TP
EL_pass
Password to use for login on remote host
.TP
EL_delay_wait_for_host
Delay (in ms) to wait for host in Not Expect, and Dynamic Var Capture. 100 ms is a good value for a local LAN, 200 ms if running across high speed internet
.TP
EL_REMOTE_HOST
Name or IP of remote host
.TP
EL_CMD_FILE
Name of expect-lite script to run
.TP
EL_USER_DIR
Change to this directory upon login
.TP
EL_*
Any other shell environment variables starting with EL_ will become constants
.PP



.SS
Debugger (IDE)
.PP
The debugger performs three primary functions: 1) connecting the user to the remote host or device under test, 2) monitoring special commands prefaced with the escape key for stepping, and other functions, and 3) the debugger will allow expect-lite script lines to be executed by either typing directly or pasting them into the IDE.
.PP
The debugger is invoked at a breakpoint by placing the *INTERACT command in the script, or using by instant-interact, at anytime during the script execution by pressing ctrl+backslash ^\\
.TP
<esc>s
Step, execute next step in script
.TP
<esc>k
sKip next step in script
.TP
<esc>c
Continue execution of the script
.TP
<esc>v
show Vars, display expect-lite variables and values
.TP
<esc>0to9
display next N lines of script
.TP
<esc>-1to-9
display last N lines of script
.TP
ctrl+d
Quit & Exit expect-lite
.TP
<esc>h
display Help
.TP
[pasted line(s)]
execute any pasted line(s) from a script into the IDE
.TP
[type any expect-lite line]
execute any typed expect-lite script line
